## SCIT
- This repository contains the first task given for SCIT, these are the questions:
1. Use numpy.random.poisson function to generate 1000 samples. Plot the histogram. Generate 1000 samples two more times and plot their histogram as well. 
2. Use numpy.random.normal function to generate 1000 samples. Plot the histogram. Generate 1000 samples two more times and plot their histogram as well
3. For Qn 1 and 2, select 100 data points at random histogram of the average of these repeating the experiment 100 times.

- ```poisson.py``` is for 1st Question.
- ```normal.py``` is for 2nd Question.
- ```average.py``` is for 3rd Question.
- ```Graphs``` folder contains all the graphs. The ```Average``` folder in ```Graphs``` contains the compiled 100 graphs of histograms of Q3.
